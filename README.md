A machine learning model to check employee burnout rate
Employee burnout is a state of physical, emotional and mental exhaustion caused by excessive and prolonged stress. It can have serious consequences on an individual’s 
well-being and can lead to decreased productivity and job performance. In today’s fast-paced and constantly connected world, it is increasingly important to recognize 
and address the signs of burnout in order to maintain the health and well-being of employees.
We will be exploring the use of regression techniques to predict employee burnout. By analyzing a dataset containing various factors that may contribute to burnout such
as workload, mental fatigue job and work-life balance, we can develop a model to identify individuals who may be at risk of burnout. By proactively addressing these risk
factors, organizations can help prevent burnout and promote the well-being of their employees
